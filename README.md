# Database Synchronization Library (C++)

## Overview

This C++ library provides functionality for database synchronization, allowing seamless synchronization of data between different databases. Whether you're working with SQL, NoSQL, or any other database system, this library aims to simplify the process of synchronizing data across multiple instances.

## Features

- Synchronize data between two or more databases.
- Support for various database systems.
- Customizable synchronization options.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into existing projects.

## Installation

### Requirements

- C++ compiler with support for C++11 or later.
- [Your Database Client Library](#) (if not already installed).

### Steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EdgeSpaceAfrica/syncdb.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the library directory:

    ```bash
    cd syncdb
    ```

3. Compile the library:

    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 -o libsyncdb.so -shared -fPIC syncdb.cpp
    ```

4. Optionally, install the library system-wide:

    ```bash
    sudo cp libsyncdb.so /usr/local/lib
    ```

## Usage

### Integration

To use the database synchronization library in your C++ project, include the header file `sync.h` in your source files:

```cpp
#include "syncdb.hpp"


## Example

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to synchronize data between two databases:

```cpp
#include "syncdb.hpp"

int main() {
    // Initialize database connections
    DatabaseConnection sourceDB("source_db");
    DatabaseConnection destinationDB("destination_db");

    // Create synchronization object
    DatabaseSync sync(sourceDB, destinationDB);

    // Perform synchronization
    sync.performSync();

    return 0;
}
```

## Customization

You can customize the synchronization process by modifying the `DatabaseSync` class according to your requirements. Refer to the documentation within the source code for detailed instructions.
